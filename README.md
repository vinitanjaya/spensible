# Spensible
Spensible is a **Streamlit web application** that helps users track their expenses automatically by extracting information from shopping receipts.  

The app uses **Tesseract OCR** for text recognition and categorizes spending into different categories (e.g., Food, Transport, Clothing), then compares it to a user-defined monthly budget.
